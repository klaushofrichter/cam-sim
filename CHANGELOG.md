# Changelog

## Unreleased

First release: the headless core (Plan 1).

- A simulated Reolink RLC-1224A (firmware v3.2.0.6011_2607012059) on HTTP and
  HTTPS: login and sessions, device info, settings with the firmware's
  whole-object write semantics, Search, Download, Snap and FLV live (H.264 sub,
  H.265 main with the legacy codec id 12), certificates, Reboot.
- The firmware's quirks are always on: the four token-rejection shapes, one
  Search and one Download at a time, raw Download source, text/html JSON
  replies, partial writes that reset omitted keys after a reboot.
- Faults to switch on: refused, dropped or slow downloads, FLV resets, failing
  or ignored settings, offline, latency, Snap errors; one-shot token revoke,
  reboot and connection drops.
- Control API (bearer token, SSE, openapi.yaml): events that create
  recordings, seeded recordings, faults, actions, reset, request log, state.
- Fixture media from ffmpeg test patterns; no camera footage anywhere.
- Container image (amd64, arm64), compose file for three cameras, in-process
  `createCamSim()` for tests, secrets sync script.
- cams' unit and e2e suites pass against cam-sim (checked in CI).
